# Address-Book

A simple Address book that contains the LAST,FIRST name, street, city, house number, state, phone number and zip code of entries.

Upon running, the program will create a text file (in the same folder location as the app). After this simply follow the on screen prompts to use the application.

Address Book.exe is the complied version of the .cpp file which is portable on any windows system!
